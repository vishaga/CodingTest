There are four tasks and which we expect you to come up with the most optimized and
clean solution for any of the four problem. Each task
should be solved by completing a corresponding java class in src/oracle/test
directory so it compiles and works in accordance to contract defined in javadoc
comments. We also expect you to write sufficient amount of tests for your implementations
in a corresponding java class in test/oracle/test directory. You can implement
tests using JUnit, TestNG framework or without a test framework.

## ArrayList.txt: For the following 3 methods

    java.util.ArrayList.subList()
    java.util.ArrayList.iterator()
    and for any one additional method chosen from java.util.ArrayList class:

	Develop a sufficient amount of unit tests using JUnit, TestNG or any other testing framework of choice (or no framework)
	Suggest two different metrics that would define how well the selected methods are tested.
