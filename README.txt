There are four tasks and which we expect you to come up with the most optimized and
clean solution for any of the three problem: ArrayList.txt, PalindromeUtil, IteratorFlattener, BlockingQueue. Each task
should be solved by completing a corresponding java class in src/oracle/test
directory so it compiles and works in accordance to contract defined in javadoc
comments.

We also expect you to write sufficient amount of tests for your implementations
in a corresponding java class in test/oracle/test directory. You can implement
tests using JUnit, TestNG framework or without a test framework. For
BlockingQueue task, you are free to use a meta-language to desribe your tests,
in that case your tests should be put as comments to BlockingQueueTest class.

When you are done, please put java files and this README into a zip archive:
$ zip -r task . -i \*.java -i README
